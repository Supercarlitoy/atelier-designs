# Scaffolding Proof — Task A3

- Verified evidence directories exist:
  - `evidence/A1_constitution-baseline/`
  - `evidence/A2_credential-audit/`
  - `evidence/A3_traceability-framework/`
- Confirmed placeholder markers present (`keep.txt`) to maintain folders in VCS.
- Checked `.ci/gates.yaml` and `.ci/workflows.md` for alignment with scaffolding requirements (coverage ≥85%, axe, perf budgets, gate thresholds).
- No additional directories required at this stage.
