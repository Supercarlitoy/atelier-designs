# Gating Checklist — Task A3

## Spec / Plan Traceability
- Spec: `specs/roadmap-execution/spec.md` (v1.0) — no edits since freeze.
- Plan: `specs/roadmap-execution/plan.md` — architecture/dependency sections reviewed.
- Tasks: `specs/roadmap-execution/tasks.md` — A1→A3 order confirmed, dependencies enforced.

## Gates Configuration
- SpecQualityGate: requires Goal/AC/Edge sections; spec satisfies.
- TemplateSyncGate: templates_version `1.0` matches `.ci/gates.yaml`.
- ChangeSyncGate: enabled; plan/tasks must regenerate on spec drift.

## Evidence Mapping
- Task A1 → `/evidence/A1_constitution-baseline/`
- Task A2 → `/evidence/A2_credential-audit/`
- Task A3 → `/evidence/A3_traceability-framework/`
- Future executions must place unit/perf/a11y artifacts within respective task folders as per template instructions.

## CI Alignment
- Coverage target 85% (from `.ci/gates.yaml`).
- Accessibility runner: axe.
- Performance budgets: API p95 400ms, LCP 2000ms, INP 200ms.
- Workflow rules documented in `.ci/workflows.md` (plan/task gate failures, merge blockers).

## Status
- Gates reviewed on 2025-09-26; no discrepancies.
- Ready for automated execution phase post-approval.
