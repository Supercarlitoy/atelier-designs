AEP: View transitions & navigation progress v1.0
Created: 2025-09-26 | Status: FROZEN | Dependencies: []

Context
- Business requirement: provide premium page/route transitions and scroll awareness.
- User impact: smoother navigation between hero/list/detail pages without disorientation.
- Constraints: use native View Transition API when available; fallback gracefully.

Execution Scope
- Deliverables: enable `experimental.viewTransition`, add shared element names, build progress bar using CSS scroll timelines.
- Success criteria: logo/hero CTA/case-study cards animate seamlessly; progress bar reflects section depth.
- Out of scope: dedicated transition choreography for every route.

Technical Specifications
- Use `view-transition-name` on shared elements, wrap Link interactions if necessary.
- Implement scroll progress using `animation-timeline: scroll()` or `view()` timeline.

Quality Evidence Required
- Functionality: captured behaviour description or gif reference.
- Performance: confirmation transforms-only, no layout thrash.

Rollback Plan
- Failure conditions: transition glitches or regressions on unsupported browsers.
- Reversion steps: disable view transitions flag and remove shared names.
- Data recovery: not applicable.
