# SPEC: Roadmap Execution Enablement (v1.0)

## Goal Statement
Convert the 15 outstanding Atelier Designs roadmap checkpoints into a governed execution package with traceable tasks, gates, and evidence expectations.

## Acceptance Criteria
- AC-1: Each checklist item maps to architecture, dependencies, risks.
- AC-2: Ordered, dependency-aware tasks with explicit acceptance + evidence.
- AC-3: Evidence structure defined pre-execution for CI, a11y, perf, security.

## Edge Cases
- Constitution absent → planning must note blocking condition.
- External services lacking credentials.
- Scope creep beyond current checklist.

## Out of Scope (MVP)
- Implementing roadmap items.
- Provisioning infra or migrations.

## Constraints
- Stack: Next.js 14, Supabase, Tailwind, Playwright
- Compliance: Supabase RLS, privacy handling
- Perf targets: LCP ≤ 2.0s, INP ≤ 200ms, API p95 ≤ 400ms
- UX/a11y: WCAG AA, reduced-motion, modal keyboard nav
