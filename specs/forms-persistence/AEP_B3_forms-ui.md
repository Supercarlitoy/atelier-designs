AEP: Form UX & error handling updates v1.0
Created: 2025-09-26 | Status: FROZEN | Dependencies: [B2]

Context
- Business requirement: Communicate persistence results clearly to users.
- User journey impact: Designers/clients must know whether submission succeeded and how to retry.
- Technical constraints: Maintain existing analytics (track events) and accessibility semantics.

Execution Scope
- Deliverables: Updated client components with loading state, error copy, and success message alignment.
- Success criteria: Buttons disabled during submission, error message uses `aria-live`, analytics fire only on success.
- Out of scope: Visual redesign beyond messaging adjustments.

Technical Specifications
- Use `useTransition` / `useState` patterns already in components.
- Map API error codes to friendly messages (e.g., `duplicate_submission`).

Quality Evidence Required
- Functionality: Annotated description or screenshot of each state stored in evidence folder.
- Accessibility: Note confirming live region + focus behavior.

Rollback Plan
- Failure conditions: Regression in existing tests or analytics events firing incorrectly.
- Reversion steps: Restore previous component versions.
- Data recovery: N/A.
